## Rust Sudoku Solver
Simple sudoku solver written in rust. My first proper rust project, so it's a little ugly.
The algorithm works but I think the code is fairly unsafe. I may come back to this later (work permitting).

Sudoku can be entered manually, or by putting the name of a file as the first argument. File just needs the 81 numbers entered in sequence. Use "0" to represent an unknown value.
